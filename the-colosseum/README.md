# The Colosseum - A Movie app

The Colosseum is a Movie App that is powered by OMDB API. It's part of my learning journey of React and also
I've always wanted to create a movie app and this is an early attempt at that wish. So, More to Come!

## What it does?
A Simple and humble app that searches for movies by the title that you've given. It provides you with
  - A list of movies under that title
  - with Release date and Media type

## The Future
Right now, It's not much. The App is minimal but it helped me solidify the basics of React. As I said, this is just an early attempt of something better in the future, with more features and a better UI!

## Improvements
This I'd like to do better 
  - Refactor the code into custom hooks
  - Give it a better UI and smoother animations at some places
  - Integrate more advanced React concepts when I learn them

## Wanna Run it?
